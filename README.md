The code was generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental), with some minor fixes.

Fixes that I remember:

- Some imports
- Add some derives: Debug, Clone
- Added second parameter for the impl of `stopped`
- Remove traling / in `.route("/ws", web`. It was getting 404

**How to Run:**

1.  Make sure you have Rust installed (`rustup`).
2.  Create the directory structure and save the files.
3.  Navigate to the `chat-app` directory in your terminal.
4.  Build the project: `cargo build`
5.  Run the server: `cargo run` (or set `RUST_LOG=trace` for more detailed logs: `RUST_LOG=trace cargo run`)
6.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
7.  Log in with `alice`/`password123` or `bob`/`securepass`.
8.  You'll be redirected to `chat.html`, and the WebSocket connection will be established.
9.  Open another browser tab/window, go to the same address, and log in as the *other* user.
10. Send messages between the two windows. Check the server console logs to see the sender/receiver IP/name logging for each message.
